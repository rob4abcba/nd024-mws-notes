## From Udacity

To run this example you'll need to use a local server. The easiest way to do so is to use the Web Server for Chrome extension.

Make sure your settings look like this: 

Chrome 200 OK settings

Under the heading that says "Web Server URL(s)" click the first link to preview the app on your local server.

Take a look at the scripts/main.js file to figure out how the route is updated and to determine when you would need to step in and manage focus
