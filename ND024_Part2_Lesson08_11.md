# Lesson 8.11 Quiz: Strategy Quiz 2

Scenario: You've Developed a self-publishing website where people post a single image with a comment.

Questions:
1. Convert to vector or keep as JPEG
2. inline or set their sources to external files?

Solution:
1. Keep as JPEG
raster so keep in raster
2. To access on mobile, keep inline if you can, to reduce number of requests.
Requests add rountrips, and roundtrips are slow.
However, in the next lesson, we see that inline images limit responsiveness, so in the end, an external file might be the answer.  Therefore, either answer here is correct.
